# active_inference
Minimal version of an active inference controller applied to a 7-DOF robot arm

## Work in progress
This repo will contain the minimal implementation of active infernce to control the real franka emika Panda 7-DOF robot arm. 
The control is going to be in the joint space using torque commands and position/velocity sensors.
